# PMIS ZIA Frontend

Programme Management Information System for Zaheerabad Industrial Area - Frontend Application

## Overview

A centralized, cloud-hosted digital platform serving as a single source of truth for infrastructure development, acting as a command center for monitoring, reporting, and analytics.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React.js 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Maps**: Leaflet / React-Leaflet
- **3D Viewer**: Three.js

## Features

### Core Modules

1. **Unified Dashboard** - Visual interface showing KPIs, milestones, alerts, and multi-domain data summary
2. **Electronic Document Management System (EDMS)** - Version control, workflow approvals, repository for drawings and reports
3. **Project Scheduling** - Timeline tracking, critical path visualization (Gantt charts)
4. **Cost Management & Procurement** - Budget forecasting, earned value analysis, contract lifecycle tracking
5. **GIS & Spatial Mapping** - Visualization of project sites, utilities, and parcel boundaries
6. **3D Model Viewer** - Interactive model of infrastructure components
7. **Risk Management** - Risk register, mitigation plans, early warning alerts

### Authentication & Access Control

The system supports role-based access control with the following roles:

- **SPV_Official** - Admin (Full access)
- **PMNC_Team** - Manager (Full control with configuration rights)
- **EPC_Contractor** - Contributor (Restricted access)
- **Consultant_Design** - Limited (Document upload, BIM viewer only)
- **Govt_Department** - Read-Only (Dashboards and reports)
- **NICDC_HQ** - Read-Only High Level (KPIs and summaries)

### Localization

Supports three languages:
- English
- Hindi (हिंदी)
- Telugu (తెలుగు)

## Google Maps API Setup

To use the GIS mapping features, you need to set up a Google Maps API key:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the "Maps JavaScript API" in the API Library
4. Create credentials (API Key) in the Credentials section
5. (Optional) Restrict the API key to your domain for security
6. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

**Note:** Google Maps offers a free tier with $200 monthly credit, which is sufficient for most development and small-scale production use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Preview production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

```

## Mock Data

The application uses mock data stored in `src/mock/data/` directory. All data is in JSON format and simulates backend API responses. The mock data includes:

- Projects
- KPIs
- Documents
- Tasks/Schedules
- Budgets
- Cost Forecasts
- Risks
- Notifications
- GIS Features
- Users

## Usage

1. Start the application
2. On the login page, select a role from the dropdown
3. Click "Enter System" to login
4. Navigate through different modules using the sidebar
5. Use the language toggle in the header to switch languages

## Development Notes

- All data is mock data - no backend API is required
- Role-based access control is implemented at the UI level
- The application is fully responsive and works on mobile devices
- Charts and visualizations use Recharts library
- Maps use Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles
- 3D viewer uses Three.js for basic 3D visualization
